# 📊 Python Data Analysis and Visualization Assignment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Python assignment focused on **data analysis with Pandas** and **data visualization with Matplotlib**.  
The goal is to load, clean, analyze, and visualize a dataset in order to gain insights from the data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and explore a dataset using **pandas**  
- Perform basic data analysis (summary statistics, grouping, patterns)  
- Visualize results using **matplotlib** (line charts, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots)  
- Document findings and observations

## 📂 Project Structure
```
📁 project-folder
 ┣ 📜 datasets.py        # Python script with analysis & visualizations
 ┣ 📜 student_performance.csv  # Dataset used
 ┗ 📜 README.md          # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.  
   Verify with:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python datasets.py
   ```
4. The program will:
   - Load the dataset  
   - Show basic statistics  
   - Generate visualizations (line, bar, histogram, scatter)  

---

## 📊 Visualizations
The following charts are generated:
1. **Line Chart** – shows trends over time (if applicable)  
2. **Bar Chart** – compares numerical values across categories  
3. **Histogram** – shows the distribution of a numerical column  
4. **Scatter Plot** – shows relationships between two numerical columns  

---

## 📝 Findings & Observations
- Summary statistics reveal patterns in student performance.  
- Grouping by categorical variables helps identify trends.  
- Visualizations make it easier to understand data distributions and relationships.
